# Car-Dataset-Analysis
## Car Dataset Analysis is a project of car dataset which is raw and is refined by eliminating irrelevant content.We have also done EDA and tested various algorithms on it to see which algorithm gives us the highest accuracy for our dataset.
## The Steps Performed are as follows:
#### 1. Import the dataset and the necessary libraries, check datatype, statistical summary,
#### shape, null values etc.
 #### 2. Are there any columns in the dataset which you think are of less relevance. If so, give
#### your reasoning and drop  them.
#### 3. Rename the columns "Engine HP": "HP", "Engine Cylinders": "Cylinders", "Transmission
#### Type": "Transmission", "Driven_Wheels": "Drive Mode","highway MPG": "MPG-H", "city
#### mpg": "MPG-C", "MSRP": "Price"
#### 4. Check for any duplicates in the data, check for null values and missing data and remove
#### them.
#### 5. Plot graphs of various columns to check for outliers and remove those data points from the
#### dataset.
#### 6. What car brands are the most represented in the dataset and find the average price among
#### the top car brands.
#### 7. Plot the correlation matrix and document your insights.
#### 8. Perform EDA and plot different graphs and document your findings (Try to see how other
#### variables affect the price of the car)
#### 9. Split the dataset into 80 and 20 ratio and build a machine learning model with
#### Price as the target variable
#### 10. Try different algorithms and check their performance over metrics like R
#### square, RMSE, MAE etc and document your findings
